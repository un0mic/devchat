## What is DevChat?

DevChat is an open-source workflow engine that enables developers to craft scripts for:
- Engaging with users through a chat panel within their IDEs, facilitating the completion of development tasks.
- Creating intelligent, automated workflows for these tasks, utilizing the full potential of various large language models (LLMs).

DevChat combines the flexibility of script writing, the cutting-edge capabilities of latest AI models, and an enriched user experience through intuitive chat GUI.

## Why DevChat?

While numerous AI coding tools exist, many still struggle to adeptly handle nuanced scenarios inherent in bespoke development processes. For instance, your team might adhere to a specific coding format that existing products don't support configuration for. Or, you desire an automated workflow to run tests and, upon encountering an error, allow AI to attempt a fix, but only once to avoid likely subsequent failures. Such specific functionalities are often not fully realized in available products.

At its core, we believe that the creativity and productivity of developers are yet to be fully unleashed. Our aim with DevChat is to simplify the integration of AI in software development to the level of writing a script, thereby unlocking new possibilities for developers.
